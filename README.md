#Faisal Alsharari-project-name- Explain_it:

##We believe that a great tutor does more than just teach.

#What this project about?:
When can we say we  have a problem? Will we can not just say this is a problem or that a problem without proving it!.
My life as a student  I had seen almost all students having a real problem which is understanding the course.Some of them feel shy, afraid, don’t know how to ask a teacher about the course if they don’t understand some of it. I have asked many students  a question  when students  can’t understand what a teacher saying in the class what would you do ?. 15% of students says that we go to the  office hour, 5% says if we don’t  find  a privet teacher we withdraw from class, 5% of student says we go to the office hour if we still not understand we will go to privet teacher. 10% says looking at Google and YouTube. Now here is my proof that we having a real problem !  65% of students say going to privet teachers! going to privet teachers will cost a lot of money !. So, I came up with Explain_it. Explain_it  is a website that students who got B+ and above become tutors for other students to help them improve and becomes more comfortable, confident …etc.
