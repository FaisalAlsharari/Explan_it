# Project-name- Explain_it:

## We believe that a great tutor does more than just teach.

# What this project about?:


<p align="center">When can we say we have a problem? We can not just say this is a problem or that is a problem without proving it! My life as a student, I have seen almost all students having a real problem, which is understanding the course. Some of them feel shy, afraid, and don’t know how to ask a teacher about the course if they don’t understand some of it. I have asked many students a question about something, when students can’t understand what the teacher is saying in the class about what to do ?. 15% of students says that we go to the office hour, 5% says if we don’t find a private teacher we should withdraw from class, 5% of students say we should go to the office hour, if we still do not understand we will go to private teacher. 10% says looking at Google and YouTube. Now here is my proof that we have a real problem ! <b> 65% of students say go to a private teacher!</b>Going to private teachers will cost a lot of money !. So I came up with Explain_it. Explain_it is a website that students who got B+ and above become tutors for other students to help them improve and become more comfortable, confident …etc.</p>
